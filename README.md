# Weather Dashboard 

## Description
- My motivation for this project was to create a working weather forecast app.
- I built this project using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- This app allows the user to get a weather forecast by typing in the name of their city.
- I learned from making this application how to integrate an API's functionality into a Javascript application.

## Installation
